# Reproducibility CI

A Travis CI definition file for code reproducibility which includes:

- linting (python with [pep8](https://pep8.org/), c/c++ with [google styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html))

## Static linting

See [pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle) for pip installable library to perform static pep8 checks on your code. This should be run prior to the creation of pull requests.
